							  predict tags to the test set.
	- build graphs			- this section appreciate the result of the classifying part by comparing
							  each part of the method seperetly, and by compare the result to previous
							  methods.
	- running code			- this section contains code that read the data and move over the previous
							  sections, one by one.
